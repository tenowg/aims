            <p>Welcome to AIMS, this website is to assist in the industry market for Evictus Alliance.</p>
            <p>I am not a HTML wizard by any means, so this site is probably going to remain ugly until I can get someone else to work on the HTML and improve how it looks... if there are any takers, please @Jenny Dawn on Discord in Evistus chat, or DM, or Evian Industries chat.</p>
            <h3>Currently what this site can do:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Give informative links in discord, just link the package address.
                <li>Allow you to notify someone via eve-mail that you are interested in purchasing anything.
                <li>Works with Evepraisal to determine price.
                <li>Makes your life alot easier.
            </ul>
            <p>Currently it might be confusing, but this will improve with time, the gist, if someone links an item in chat, follow the link, deside what you want to buy, send the eve-mail, wait for contract.</p>
            <p>Too add items, just click the on the navmenu on the left hand of the page, the hanburger opens it up.</p>
            <p>Don't forget to link the item in chat...</p>
            <p>Feel free to contact me at any time, thanks</p>
